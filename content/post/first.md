Many teams see Git as a source of frustration. A painful reminder that the rubber needs to meet the road in order to make ends meet and keep our customers happy. They see Git as just a mechanism to transport the code from development machines to production servers and keep everyone in sync.

But I want Git to do more. Being distributed means Git gives us the opportunity to do something really amazing. It allows us to make quick commits locally without breaking flow and then allows us to rewrite those commits into a cohesive story that we share with our team.

  return foo * 2
}
```

What I'm documenting here is an extension of the full-bleed CSS Grid layout.

For this next iteration, I explored applying these breakout offsets using CSS grid and named grid lines.
