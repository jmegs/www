Currently leading the design systems team at [Squarespace][1], John is a generalist design leader with expertise across the "full stack" of product design — from clarifying complex ecosystems and business needs to executing prototypes and production software in code.

His current focus at Squarespace is building tools and processes that enable a coherent platform experience. In other words, the "instruction manuals" to the classic design systems "lego bricks." He has also led onboarding, education and cross-team collaboration to drive new user success, and built new tools for brick & mortar business owners. 

Previously John worked in Experience Strategy and Design at [R/GA][2], building products and tech-enabled consumer experiences for the world's biggest brands.

When not drawing rectangles on screen, he’s a passionate home cook, restaurant goer, and lover of interior design, science fiction, and hikes – especially ones that end at a great place to eat.
