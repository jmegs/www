      To understand the spacial needs of the experience, I ran roleplaying exercises with paper mockups. 
      This let us mark any time the “salesperson” needed a visual or interactive aid in their pitch.

      To iterate with the correct context, and validate technical feasibility, 
      I helped build a fully-functional scale replica of the installation. 
      This one features 100% more cardboard and duct tape than the final.

    caption: >
      By laying paper over capacitive circuit boards, 
      I was able to rapidly validate physical interface ideas for each element of the experience. 
      This prototype inspired the production solution of laying printed vinyl “interface” over the installation in-store.

      The monitoring dashboard homescreen gives Samsung an everyday overview of key metrics.
      Is it broken? Is it drawing shoppers in?

Samsung's TV retail display, 
deployed in 1000s of stores nationwide,
was showing its age. 
Customers weren't understanding key product features,
and retail staff spent too much time fixing equipment failures. 
We needed to increase the reliability of the technology 
and clarify the customer experience.

Relying on field research, rapid physical prototyping, 
and close collaboration with hardware and software engineers, 
we created a networked system of installations 
which could be monitored and administered remotely. 

I also designed a companion dashboard that — in a company first — 
let the Samsung team observe and improve the experience in real time.

Samsung deployed the new system in Best Buy stores nationwide 
and saw significant performance gains in the first year:

- **2x** increase in consumer understanding of product features.
- **96%** average uptime nationwide.
