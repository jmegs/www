      I wrote an initial spec to map the design intent of color theming
      onto the existing Squarespace styling framework

To address user feedback requesting more creative flexibility, I worked with a small team to prototype a color theming system. We needed to balance Squarespaceâ€™s characteristic ease of use with tools to make more varied, expressive websites.

Working within the significant constraints of the existing Squarespace frontend, they system gives novice users curated starting points known to work well, along with generative color tools that let people with existing brands to turn one color or image into a full site color palette.

Once in production the resulting system resulted in:
- Increased diversity & expressivness across user sites
- Decreased maintenance burden & higher velocity for internal teams

_Note: Shown here are the results of a spike of work around system definition, prototyping, and concept testing. The solution in-product today was implemented and continually iterated on by our Web Presence product teams._
