Founding designer of the Squarespace Trial Experience team, which had two missions: to help new Squarespace users get to value quickly, and help the Squarespace organization learn about the needs and pain points of their customers.

The team worked in a new-to-Squarespace methodology based on fast experimentation and learning. We ran lots of experiements that, while not always improving conversion, netted important learning for the organization.

This iterative process values metrics and learning equally, but we have seen significant business impact from this work.

- Major increases in trial conversion rates
- Millions of new customer data points unlocked for downstream teams
