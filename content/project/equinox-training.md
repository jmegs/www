      Our research highlighted how much extra work trainers (blue) were doing
      for every client touchpoint (red). Meanwhile the brand (black) was barely 
      involved in the client experience.

      The existing system was a mixture of old-school web dashboard, Google
      sheets, and 3rd party messaging services. Trainers had to bounce between all three systems, 
      while clients got an un-polished, un-branded experience.

      Is my business tracking well? Who am I seeing today? What am I doing with them?

      Drilling into the client list view,
      trainers can easily see client progress over time. 
      This information previously spanned several apps and websites.
      Viewing it all at once creates more opportunies to give clients positive news.

This end-to-end redesign of Equinox’s personal training system aimed to solve two problems of attrition. Both the personal training client churn rate and the number of trainers quitting were increasing year over year.

After immersive research, we identified the core drivers of this decline — lack of percieved value for clients, and trainers overburdened with admin work. Our new solution modernizes the client experience and provides direct indicators of value over time, while drastically reducing the trainer workload.

As the new solution rolled out in waves across the country, we recieved excellent preliminary results:

- **4.5/5** star rating from trainers.
- **100%** said it will be valuable for their clients.
