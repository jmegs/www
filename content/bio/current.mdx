Currently leading the design systems team at [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com), John is a generalist design leader with expertise across the "full stack" of product design — from clarifying complex ecosystems and business needs to executing prototypes and production software in code.

His current focus at Squarespace is building tools and processes that enable a coherent platform experience. In other words, the "instruction manuals" to the classic design systems "lego bricks." He has also led onboarding, education and cross-team collaboration to drive new user success, and built new tools for brick & mortar business owners.
