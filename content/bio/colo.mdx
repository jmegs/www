Designed and built by hand with the wildly unnecessary but very fun tech stack of [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org), [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). Typeset in [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) by Neal Panchal â€” "a love letter to the golden era of computing." Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/jmegs/www).
