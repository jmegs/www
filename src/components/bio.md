Currently leading the design systems team at [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com),
John is a generalist design leader with expertise across the full stack of product and experience design — from mapping complex service ecosystems to executing prototypes and production software in code.

His current focus at Squarespace is building tools and processes that enable a coherent platform experience. In other words, the "instruction manuals" to the classic design systems "lego bricks."
He has also led growth teams using onboarding and education to drive new user success, and built new tools for brick & mortar business owners.

Previously John worked as an Experience strategist and designer at [R/GA](https://rga.com), building products and tech-forward consumer experiences for the world's biggest brands.

When not drawing rectangles on screen, he’s a lover of food and wine, science fiction, and outdoor adventures like skiing and hikes – especially ones that end at a great place to eat.
